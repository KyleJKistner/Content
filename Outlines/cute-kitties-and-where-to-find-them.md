# Proposed title

Cute kitties and where to find them

## Structure

1. A brief introduction on exchanges (crypto and fiat)
2. A brief primer on collectibles (physical and digital)
3. Why we need decentralized exchanges, their history, how they work, and where things are as we speak (0x)
4. A brief introduction to the ERC process
5. ERC-20 to ERC-721 and beyond
6. Tying non-fungible tokens and decentralized exchanges together
7. A vision for the future to be excited for (this is where I introduce ConsenSys Academy and further readings)

## Why you want to write this

It covers two important topics that are important for vastly different reasons:

- Decentralized exchanges are crucial because centralized exchanges are the barrier to entry into the decentralized world.
- Non-fungible tokens are one of the easiest ways we can infiltrate into society and change the perception of "oh, I don't think that Bitcoin stuff is going to work." No, blockchain isn't just about disrupting future markets and boring enterprise stuff, you can do cool and meaningful stuff with it, today.

## Why someone should read this

The audience I have in mind are those who are curious about the possibilities offered by the Ethereum ecosystem and have some background in tech â€“ not necessarily as a developer, but possibly even as a technology enthusiast. Maybe they're trying to see what programming language to learn next and whether solidity would make sense.

So, given the audience, they will read it because it tells them what they can do with the technology today, and something larger (e.g., decentralized exchange) to get inspired by and work towards.
